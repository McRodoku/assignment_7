      This dog is Todoroki, or Roki for short. He's ten months old, so he still has some growing left to do! He may look like a lab, but he's actually:

    <ls> 50% German Shephard</ls>
    <ls> 20% Pitbull</ls>
    <ls> 20% Staffie</ls>
    <ls> 10% Doberman Pinscher.</ls>
  <p>
    His favorite things to do are hang out with his Mom, chew on things he's not supposed to, chase deer and squirrels, meet new people, and play outside. He's very social and has tons of other dog friends in the neighborhood.
    He's a little fearful at times, but he's a cuddlebug through and through.
